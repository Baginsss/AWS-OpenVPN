# AWS-OpenVPN

In order to learn more about cloud, especially AWS services, I've decided to do some practical projects, although they are unshareable via github, I still want to note my progress.

For my first cloud computing project I took challenge of creating my own vpn. Lately, there are all over internet about how vpn providers are sharing/selling/storing data of their users from famous NordVPN to some "smallers" ones, such news indicates demand for setting their own vpn. I know it is quiet ironically to set up vpn instead on amazon server, but still in my opinion it is less risky than buying services from else where.
